	<h2>About Lambda Labs</h2>
	<p>Lambda Labs is a software firm dedicated to the creation of useful and robust programs.
	   We are interested in moving the industry forward through the production of languages,
	   libraries, tools, and research that help developers to reach better solutions.</p>	 

	<h2>Our Projects</h2>
	<p>We have open-sourced many projects recently. These projects include a type-system
	   for vanilla JavaScript, a testing suite for Java, a statistical performance assesser
	   for JavaScript, an API test-suite, and a custom Lisp dialect.</p>

	<p>All of these projects began within Lambda Labs to tackle a certain problem, and
	   were then released into the public that other developers might benefit from them.</p>

	<h2>Our Products</h2>
	<p>We have made quite a few products, either for sale to consumers or to meet the
	   needs of a client. Our earliest product was a gaming website, one which grew to
	   over ten-thousand daily views. We then entered into the app market with tools
	   for math and chemistry, as well as a tool for saving media to the cloud. We
	   continue to create new websites and apps for various platforms including iOS,
	   Android, and Mac.</p>

	<p>For our clients, we have made a social network, a geolocation app, and some
	   education apps adopted by the local high school diocese. Additionally, we have
	   made ecommerce websites and business tools for our clients.</p>
